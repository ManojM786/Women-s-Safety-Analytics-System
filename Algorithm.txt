🚀 Women Safety Analytics System - Algorithm 🚀
📌 Objective
This system processes a video to detect persons and cars, classify gender, recognize emotions, and detect potential SOS situations using advanced AI models.

🛠 Step 1: Initialization
🔹 Load YOLOv8 for detecting persons and cars.
🔹 Load EfficientNet Gender Classifier (trained on PETA dataset).
🔹 Load YOLO Face Detector (for emotion recognition only).
🔹 Load DeepSORT for object tracking.
🔹 Load Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) Model.
🔹 Initialize EasyOCR for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).
🔹 Set up MediaPipe Pose & Hands for SOS gesture recognition.

🎥 Step 2: Process Video Frame-by-Frame
🔹 Read each frame from the input video.
🔹 Run YOLOv8 to detect objects (persons & cars).
🔹 Pass detected objects to DeepSORT to track them over time.

🧑‍🤖 Step 3: Process Each Tracked Object
👥 If the object is a person:
✔️ Classify Gender (Man/Woman) using EfficientNet.
✔️ Store track ID & gender to ensure consistency.
✔️ Draw Bounding Boxes:

🟦 Blue for Men
🟩 Green for Women
✔️ If the person is a woman:

🎭 Detect face using YOLO (if visible).
🎭 Classify facial emotion using FER.
🚨 If emotion is Sad, Fear, Disgust, or Angry → Perform SOS detection.
🚗 If the object is a car:
✔️ Extract the bounding box.
✔️ Run ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition).
✔️ Store detected license plate numbers.

🚨 Step 4: SOS Gesture Recognition for Women
📌 Performed only if emotion is negative.

🔹 Extract body pose using MediaPipe Pose Estimation.
🔹 Detect hand gestures using MediaPipe Hands (Raised Hand, Waving, etc.).
🔹 Detect running or sudden movements.

✔️ If at least 2 out of 3 conditions are met → Mark as "SOS Detected"
✔️ Draw 🟥 Red bounding box & log the SOS event.

👤 Step 5: Lone Woman Tracking
🔹 Track women who are alone for 10+ seconds.
🔹 If a woman remains alone beyond the threshold, flag her as Lone Woman.

📄 Step 6: Generate Outputs
📌 Processed Output Video with bounding boxes.
📌 Report (report.txt) including:

Total Men & Women detected
Total SOS cases
Total License plates identified
Lone women tracking results
📌 Car license plate data saved in (car_results.csv).

🏁 Step 7: Final Processing & Cleanup
🔹 Release video resources.
🔹 Print “Detection Completed” message.

💡 Key Features & Optimizations
✅ Gender classification happens immediately after person detection (EfficientNet).
✅ Face detection is used ONLY for emotion recognition (not gender classification).
✅ DeepSORT ID consistency is improved (max_age=90) to prevent gender misclassification.

🎯 Final Thoughts
This AI-powered system ensures accurate gender classification, real-time emotion detection, and SOS recognition, making it an effective women’s safety analytics solution.
